# WW-week-1-image-slider

A basic CSS and JS image slider

DEV PLAN

make a container to hold the image slider and center it

design a header

make an image container

print out the images to the browser page and organize them

make buttons that will cycle through the images

make a way for the event listener to cycle through the images.

make the transition slow and more like a sliding effect rather than an immediate image change.

make the change from the first image to the last and vice versa actually go to the beginning of the image array, or give the illusion that it is happening.

find a way to hide the other images, giving the illusion that we are changing just one image at a time

position and style the buttons

install font icons from font awesome to change button into arrows.
